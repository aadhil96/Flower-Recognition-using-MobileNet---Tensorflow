# Flower-Recognition-using-MobileNet-Tensorflow
In this project we are mainly focusing towards how we can build a dataframe from folders of images and classify them with deep neural nets.

#### Data Source : ![Link](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
- This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers.
- The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images.
- You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo.

The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion.For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!
